Milestone Project l: Jett Beams
I wanted to go for other verisons of games. Like a whole turn based story. But at the moement i feel as though i have a lot to learn

So i decied on making a version on everyones favorite flappy bird 
The game is played by simply click the left mouse button which then pushes you character up and your goal is to then get through the gap in the steel beams.

i decided to go with a semi built template, one which assited me a little as well as left me with tons of work

The game takes more of a cyberpunk style with how the background looks as well as the character model
I unfortunately had to go for a non action animated character(as well as a starwars jangofett pixel) since no other ones were in flying motion nor were free

The game still currently lacks any sound as well as still had a plain black slab inbetween the beams to indicate the safe area in which it is able to pass
