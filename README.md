Milestone Project: version of happy bird 
I wanted to go for other verisons of games. Like a whole turn based story. But at the moement i feel as though i have a lot to learn

So i decied on making a version on everyones favorite flappy bird 

Decide to go for a cyberpunk city and used a template that had very little mobilty and 0 css. The hardest part was getting a character since most characters came with annyoing backgrounds that put teh character into a little box. So i needed to use a plain image with transparency behind it. 

I also had audio with adding a onclick sound button
